<!--Why you should go there-->

<h2>Why Should I Go There?</h2>
	<p>This beautiful, secluded beach is located on the Big Sur coast of California. The purple sand is caused by 
	manganese garnet in the nearby cliffs being eroded away. The best time to view the purple is directly after 
	rain or storms. Unfortunately, swimming is discouraged due to many rocks and strong currents. However, it is 
	a beautiful place for a walk or a picnic and is even dog friendly! The breathtaking views are definitely worth
	visiting.</p>
